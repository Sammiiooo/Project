        <p>Dogs have different nutritional requirements from humans and the food you eat might be harmful to your pet! Home cooked meals, unless prepared by veterinary nutritionists, lack in the basic nutrients required for the healthy growth and development of your pet. Prepared pet foods, on the other hand, offer guaranteed nutrition, palatability, digestibility, safety and convenience. In addition they also offer diversity without loss of consistency and offer better value for money than home cooked food. The following chart will help you to decide on a controlled diet for your pooch.</p>

        <p>1. The nutrient requirement of dogs change depending on their life stage and lifestyle. For example, a puppy requires a higher amount of energy, protein, calcium and phosphorus for growth.</p>

<p>2. An adult human male needs 2500 kcal/day while an adult dog of 65 kg needs 2520 kcal/day. While eating those 2520 calories, the dog has to have a higher concentration of nutrients than humans.</p>

<p>3. Homemade diets may also contain contaminants and food-borne microbes if the owner is not as careful. Strict rules and regulations ensure that packaged pet food is free from microbial contaminants such as Salmonella or mycotoxins.</p>

<p>4. To meet the nutritional requirements of a dog, pet parents often tend to overfeed because homemade food are not governed by any canine dietary guidelines. Prepared pet-foods  always have a feeding  guide to  help the  owner  ensure  the  pet  is fed the correct amount  of calories for its life-stage and lifestyle.</p>

<p>5. Dogs are allergic to many foods that humans consume and sometimes, they also prove to be poisonous. Manufactured pet foods never contain ingredients that are unsafe for pets.</p>
