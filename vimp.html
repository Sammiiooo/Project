        <p>Vaccination has long been an effective way to reduce disease burden in pets and is a key tool in maintaining animal health and welfare. Vaccines continue to play an increasingly vital role in preventative health and disease control programmes in animals. Innovative research and the development of safe, effective and quality vaccines means that our pets continue to benefit from vital medicines that prevent or alleviate clinical signs of disease.</p>

<h3>Feline Vaccinations</h3><p>
Many of the most important diseases in cats can be prevented, controlled or alleviated through effective vaccination. These include:

Feline Panleukopenia/Infectious Enteritis (Feline Panleukopenia or Parvovirus, FPV)
Feline Rhinotracheitis (Feline Herpesvirus, FHV)
Feline Calicivirus (FCV)
Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV)
Chlamydophila felis
Feline Rabies
In 2015, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD) produced updated best practice vaccination guidelines for indoor and outdoor cats, rescue shelter cats and breeding catteries (10). These guidelines recommend that ‘core’ vaccines should be administered to all cats (FPV, FHV, FCV) and ‘non-core’ are recommended only for cats at risk of specific infection. Additionally, ‘circumstantial’ vaccines are needed in specific circumstances such as Rabies vaccination for cats travelling in and out of the UK – often referred to as the PETS travel scheme. The ABCD also provide recommendations on vaccination schedules for the primary vaccination course and subsequent boosters, which take into consideration the type of vaccine product and vaccination history. </p>

<h3>Canine Vaccinations</h3><p>
The veterinary medicines regulator, the VMD, have published a position paper on authorised vaccination schedules for dogs including core and non-core vaccines (9). The important canine diseases, for which vaccines are available, include:

Canine Distemper Virus (CDV)
Canine Parvovirus (CPV)
Canine Adenovirus (CAV)
Canine Leptospira
Canine parainfluenza virus (CPi)
Bordetella bronchiseptica
Canine Rabies
The core canine vaccines include CDV, CAV and CPV – these protect dogs from severe life threating viruses, whilst canine leptospira, CPi and Bordetella bronchiseptica for animals who are at risk due to their geographical location, local environment or lifestyle and are considered non-core (9). Other vaccines authorised for use in dogs in Canine Herpes and Canine Coronavirus (Canine Enteric Coronavirus, CECOV). </p>

<h3>Rabbit Vaccination</h3><p>
Vaccination of pet rabbits is an important part of a proactive approach to preventative healthcare and is widely recommended to protect rabbits from two very serious viral infectious diseases – myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. These diseases can result in rabbits needing prolonged intensive care treatment and in many cases the most serious viral diseases of rabbits are fatal. Vaccinating to protect rabbits against these two deadly diseases therefore makes good sense and the benefits are clearly evident in terms of reducing rabbit suffering and death and alleviating owner distress.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Vaccination is an effective way to prevent or reduce disease in pets.
Vaccines are available for a range of important bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic diseases – many of which are difficult or impossible to treat.
All vaccines on the market meet rigorous safety, efficacy and quality standards and are assessed by an independent veterinary medicines regulator before they are authorised for use.
Preventative health measures, such as a robust vaccination strategy can reduce the need for veterinary treatments and improve responsible antibiotic use.
There is no ‘one size fits all’ vaccination strategy and consultation with your vet to discuss specific disease risk factors is important to decide on the most appropriate vaccines for animals in your care.
Although it is not always technically possible to develop an effective vaccine, the animal medicines sector continues to invest and innovate in vaccine technology to support endemic and exotic disease prevention and control. Vaccines are therefore part of a wider range of animal medicines available to prevent or treat disease.</p>
