Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need a diet of meat for their survival. In cat food you should see meats as the first ingredient, remember they are true carnivores. Prepared pet foods, offer guaranteed nutrition, palatability, digestibility, safety and convenience. In addition they also offer diversity without loss of consistency and offer better value for money than home cooked food. Cats require different amount of food intakees as they grow in size.

       <p>1. Cat food is food for consumption by cats. Cats have specific requirements for their dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid nutritional deficiency.</p>
<p>2. The idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than dog food and dog biscuits. This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves.</p>
<p>3. Cats are obligate carnivoresâ€”meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable.
